Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN and RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN.

INNER JOIN (JOIN default) returns matching values from both tables.

LEFT JOIN returns all values from the left table and all the matching values from the right table

RIGHT JOIN Same as LEFT but the other way around
